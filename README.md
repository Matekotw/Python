Here are three simple projects using Python that demonstrate my skills and interest in coding and cybersecurity. The projects are as follows:

1) The first project is a password generator.
2) The second project is a QR code generator.
3) The third project is a password checker, which uses a password.txt file.

To run these projects, you will need a Python editor and the necessary modules.

For the password generator (PassGen.py), you will need the "secrets" and "string" modules.
For the QR code generator (qr_code_gen.py), you will need the "qrcode" module.

To run the programs, follow these steps:
1) Open a new project in a Python editor.
2) Install the required modules.
3) Run the programs.
