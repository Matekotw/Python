Here are three Python projects that showcase my coding skills and interests in cybersecurity:

1. The first project is a password generator.
2. The second project is a QR code generator.
3. The third project is a password checker that utilizes a password.txt file.

To run these programs, you will need a Python editor and the necessary modules.

For the password generator (PassGen.py), you will need the "secrets" and "string" modules.
For the QR code generator (qr_code_gen.py), you will need the "qrcode" module.
Additionally, for the password checker (password_checker.py), you need to include a "password.txt" file in the same folder.

To run the programs, follow these steps:
1. Open a new project in a Python editor.
2. Install the required modules.
3. Run the programs.
